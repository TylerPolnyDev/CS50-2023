Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I thought that the processing time would increase linearly, but it seems it increased at a faster rate

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 simulations. at this point we have many answers, there after the answers change slightly if at all.
